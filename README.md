    About Me 👋
  </code>
</h4>

My name is **Dora**. I am a full-stack developer who is **heavy empathizes**
with developing and designing **_the best experience for users_**.

Years since I have started to program, I have been transiting from **C** to
**C++** to **C#** then **Java**, and now **JavaScript**, it is one of the most
technology that I really enjoy working with. Shortly after I got introduced to
**React**, and **React Native**, I am so in love with these technologies so much
that I decided to be stick with them.
